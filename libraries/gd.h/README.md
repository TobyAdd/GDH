# gd.h
- windows geometry dash headers i use for textureldr. moving this here so i can use it for multiple projects, since they'll be the same

# note
- these headers require cocos2d-x headers. i recommend [cappucino](https://github.com/andrenih/cappuccinoSDK/), but i use my own. those can be found in textureldr.
- compile settings can and will mess up some of these headers. the compile settings i use for textureldr are:
    - 32-bit (duh)
    - release mode, maximum optimization for speed (o2)
